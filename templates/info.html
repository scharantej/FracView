<h1>Mandelbrot Ensemble</h1>
<p>The Mandelbrot ensemble is a set of all parameter values for a given complex quadratic equation that produce a bounded set of iterates.</p>
<p>The most famous member of the Mandelbrot ensemble is the Mandelbrot set, which is defined by the following equation:</p>

z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c

<p>where z<sub>0</sub> = 0 and c is a complex constant.</p>
<p>The Mandelbrot set is a fractal with a very complex and intricate structure. It is known for its self-similarity and its ability to generate beautiful and unexpected patterns.</p>
<p>The Mandelbrot explorer on this page allows you to explore the Mandelbrot ensemble by zooming in and out, panning around, and changing the color scheme.</p>
